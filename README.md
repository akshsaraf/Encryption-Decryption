# Hybrid Encryption and Decryption Program

This program implements a hybrid encryption and decryption system using a custom encryption method that combines XOR encryption, salting, and shuffling. It allows you to securely encrypt and decrypt text-based data. 

## Features

- **Custom Hybrid Encryption**: Combines XOR encryption, salt, and shuffle techniques.
- **Text Encryption and Decryption**: Encrypt and decrypt strings of text using the custom algorithm.
- **Configurable Encryption**: Modify encryption settings via a configuration file.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed before running the program:

- Python 3.x
- Required Python packages:
  - `cryptography`
  - `json`

You can install the required package using:

```bash
pip install cryptography
